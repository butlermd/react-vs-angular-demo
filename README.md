# React Chat
Demo app to assess React

## Set up
Install Node and make sure you have the latest npm with `npm install npm -g`. 

Install other global dependencies with with `npm install windows-build-tools gulp -g`.

Install local dependencies with `npm install`.

## Run the server
Run `gulp server` from the primary directory to start up the server. Next, to run the the angular application, `cd ng` and run `gulp serve`. To start up the React application, go back to the root directory and `cd react` followed by `gulp watch`.
  
#### TODO:
In the future, we can simplify this start up process by creating a single task to run everything.
